# Neko-Eats
A cross-platform customizable mobile app for restaurants that's built using Flutter.

Food delivery apps that act like an intermediary between Restaurants and Customers have grown leaps and bounds in the past half decade. But the margins taken by these intermediary services impact both small as well as large scale restaurants at a substantial level. In order to prevent the customers from paying extra and the restaurant owners from earning less, Neko Eats customises apps for the restaurants based on their preference, on their terms and conditions, so that the buyer can come in direct contact with the seller.
